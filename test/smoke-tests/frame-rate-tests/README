Some basic animation tests to help see what kinds of animation are possible on
what architectures.

Usage:
  CLUTTER_SHOW_FPS=1 gjs clutter.js [crossfade/slide] [1080/720]
  GDK_DEBUG=frames gjs gtk.js [crossfade/slide] [1080/720]

You can choose between a cross fade and a slide, and a 1080 or 720 image asset
to animate. (The screen resolution and not the asset size should really
determine frame rate, but just in case.)

Clutter will print out a proper frame rate, whereas GTK will print out
a series of intervals between draw updates. During an animation these 
should be at 16 milliseconds for 60 FPS.

Click to trigger a slide. Press any key to quit.
